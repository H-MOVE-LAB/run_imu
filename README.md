Template-based method for the estimation of running temporal parameters using foot-mounted inertial sensors

This repository contains the Matlab codes to estimate running temporal parameters (initial contact instants, final contact instants, stride duration, stance duration, and swing duration) from accelerations and angular velocities recorded by a foot-mounted inertial sensor. 
The method is based on dynamic time warping to compare a generic running trial (at any speed) with the provided templates. Templates are speed-specific: a template at slow running speed (10 km/h), a template at moderate running speed (14 km/h), and a template ad high running speed (26 km/h). 

Prerequisites
- Matlab: MATLAB R2021b or later;
- Signal processing Toolbox of Matlab.

 Feel free to reach out if you need more information or if you encounter any issues while running the code.
